            <p class="text">There are days when all you need is to look at the sea.
                Sit on the sand, feel the wind on your face, and listen to the sound of the waves coming and going, like the
                beat of an ancient, calm heart. It's as if the world slows down just by being there, in front of that
                endless blue.
                The sea doesn't answer, but it listens.
                It doesn't speak, but it understands.
                Maybe that's why so many people go there when their minds feel heavy or their hearts tight. Because looking
                at the sea is like finding peace without needing to say a word.</p>
